## How to run

Firstly you will need a Postgres database you can use the docker-compose.yaml
(to use this file you will need to configure the secrets you can find more
information [here](https://docs.docker.com/compose/use-secrets/)) in this
repository to do this, after that you just need to run the script.sql (available
in /docs/script.sql) and `deno task dev`.
